%% Algorithm

% TODO: implement
% To generate the texture we need a sample frame that clearly shows the
% surrounding texture around the marker, and we need to determine the
% homography. We'll use 
% general loop:
%   1. Find homography between marker and its location in the vide frame
%   2. Composite synthesized texture onto frame
